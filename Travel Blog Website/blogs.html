;">An Essential Guide to The Philippines</h1>
  <br>
  The Philippines is a relatively easy travel destination by Southeast Asian standards. English is widely spoken, and the country has an endearing don't-worry-be-happy vibe, soothing for first-time visitors.It’s tough to think of a more beautiful corner of the world than the Philippines, with white sand beaches, bath-temperature water, and incredibly friendly locals.<span id="dots">...<br><br><br></span><span id="more">
These islands, 7,107 of them to be exact, are worth a departure from the typical banana pancake trail in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam! The beaches are regarded as some of the best in the world, as are the diving opportunities, and the welcoming nature of the Filipino people is unwavering.<br><br>

But with so many islets to choose from offering up various culture, adventure and culinary delights, where do you even start to plan an itinerary and figure out where to go in the Philippines? Well luckily enough, We have spent roughly two months in the Philippines and have wrapped up our experiences into one neat little package below. Let’s get to planning your perfect Philippines itinerary:
<br>
<h1>1) Manila</h1>
<p>It’s likely that you’ll begin your journey in the capital, Manila. A city bustling with people, Spanish colonial architecture, street vendors and Jeepneys.  Many travellers use Manila simply as a gateway to other destinations in the Philippines but we would recommend spending at least a day there in preparation for the rest of your adventure. It will also give you enough time to purchase your bus ticket to the North of Luzon, acclimatize, and sample street food like quack quack (battered quail egg) and caramelized bananas.</p>
<p><b>Quick Tip:</b> Take a Jeepney ride for as little as 10PHP to a random destination in town. Just get off where you feel spontaneous!</p>
<h1>2) North Luzon</h1>

<p>North Luzon is very much overlooked in the Philippines with travelers opting for pristine white beaches and crystal cobalt seas instead. However, we would highly recommend a trip into the mountainous region for a glimpse into the World of the local rice farmers and stunning craggy landscapes. The UNESCO Banaue rice terraces are a key highlight of any trip to the North.</p>
<p><b>Top Tip:</b> Most travelers visit Banaue due to the UNESCO title stamped across its name, however just an hour up the road (or up the mountain) lie Batad rice terraces which are just as beautiful and have far fewer tourists.

An overnight stay will allow you to live like the locals in a traditional stilt house built into the terrace. A trek to a neighboring waterfall is also on the agenda here and highly recommended! Wear a bathing suit and take a dip!<br><br>

;">The Little Rann of Kutch</h1>
  <br>
  Kutch, India’s Wild West, is a geographic phenomenon. It derives its name from katchua or kachbo, meaning a tortoise and is surrounded by sea water. Ancient temples, attractive palaces, rugged forts, flamingos, wild asses — you have it all in Kutch. But most of it is covered by Rann of Kutch, a shallow wetland with marshy salt flats that look like an endless mass of snow spread as far as the eye can see.<span id="dots1">...<br><br><br></span><span id="more1">
The Rann of Kutch is divided into the Great Rann Of Kutch and the Little Rann Of Kutch.The Great Rann of Kutch spans an area of 7505.22 sq km. It is home to a wide array of flora and fauna. During diverse weather conditions migratory birds find a home here. The Little Rann of Kutch occupies 4,953 sq km and is spread out in the districts of Surendranagar, Banasakantha, Patan, Kutch and Rajkot in Gujarat. The Wild Ass Sanctuary in Kutch houses the endangered Ghudkhur.

Kutch also hosts a three-month long annual festival called Rann Utsav which attracts thousands of people to the beautiful White Desert. PM Modi too has attended this festival several times. The beauty of the Rann increases manifold when a riot of colors are splashed when people wearing colorful, ethnic wear perform folk dance and music during the Rann Utsav.<br><br>
<p>
  BEST PLACES TO STAY IN KUTCH :<br>
There are a number of lodging options available in the main town and city area of this region. If you are attending Rann Utsav, you can stay in luxury tents near the venue. These offer package deals where you can go for sightseeing, adventure sports and more. But if you prefer staying in a resort, you can opt for Rann Riders, an eco-resort that also organize camel, horse and jeep safaris. Shaam-e-Sarhad is a village resort that offers a rustic experience to travelers. The Fern Residency Mundra is an option for those who wish to stay in a standard hotel.<br>
<br>
BEST PLACES TO EAT IN KUTCH :<br>
Hotels serving vegetarian food are in plenty. The eatables are mostly made out of milk, bajara and wheat. Kutch’s staple diet does not include rice but pulses (dal) are available.When in Kutch, do try their local cuisine called the Kutchi cuisine. It is quite different from Gujarati fare and has minimum oil and is not sweet. It is in fact one of the healthiest cuisines with their dishes made using fresh ingredients. JP Resort has a restaurant that offers authentic Kutchi food. If you can’t do without non-veg food, head to Noorani Mahal. Other places to eat are Osho Restaurant if you like Gujarati thali   and Neelam restaurant for other Indian cuisines.

<br><br>
BEST TIME TO VISIT KUTCH :<br>
Ideally, November to March is the best time to visit Kutch as the water dries up in the area. So, you can actually witness the great salt desert. Also, the weather is more agreeable over this time and you also get to witness the Great Rann Utsav festival. The Rann Utsav Festival is held every year from December end to February end, a happening time to visit Kutch. You get to eat amazing food and watch entertaining performances. And, you can also shop for amazing Gujarati dresses and accessories at a reasonable price.

Also, make sure that you travel to this place on a Full Moon or a day when the moonrise is a little early in the evening. This is because the white desert in the moonlight is certainly one of the most beautiful and magnificent sight ever.
